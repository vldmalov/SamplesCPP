GCC compile
1) The standard way to compile this program is with the command
g++ main.cpp -o main

2) If you use the -E option, nothing is done except preprocessing
g++ -E main.cpp > someFileName

2) Два файла. Компилируем и линкуем в бинарник main
g++ main.cpp utils.cpp -o main

3) Alternatively, the above program could be compiled using the following two commands
g++ -c main.cpp
g++ -c utils.cpp
g++ main.o utils.o -o main

4) параметр одиннадцатых плюсов
-std=c++11


The end result is the same, but this two-step method first compiles hello.C 
into a machine code file named "hello.o" and then links hello.o with some system libraries to produce the final program "hello". 
In fact the first method also does this two-stage process of compiling and linking,
but the stages are done transparently, and the intermediate file "hello.o" is deleted in the process.
